    /**
     * Method overloading in Java means defining multiple methods with the same name in the same class, but with different parameters.
     * It allows a method to perform similar operations in different ways, depending on the number or type of inputs.
     * Rules for Method Overloading:
     * To overload a method, you must change at least one of the following:
     * Number of parameters
     * Type of parameters
     * Order of parameters (if types are different)
     * Only Changing the return type is not enough for overloading, for it to work properly it must differentiate it parameters.
